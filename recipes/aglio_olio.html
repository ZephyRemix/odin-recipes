        <!-- Aglio Olio recipe description -->
        <p>Aglio e Olio, a classic Italian pasta dish, exudes simplicity yet packs a punch of flavor. The name translates to "garlic and oil," and that's essentially what it is—a dish where the starring ingredients shine brightly. In its purest form, aglio e olio features al dente spaghetti tossed in a luscious sauce made from olive oil infused with minced garlic, red pepper flakes for a kick, and parsley for a fresh finish. The magic lies in the way these humble ingredients transform into a dish that's greater than the sum of its parts. The garlic, gently sautéed until golden and aromatic, infuses the oil with its essence, creating a base that coats each strand of pasta with its rich flavor. The red pepper flakes add a subtle heat that dances on the palate, while the parsley brightens the dish with its herbaceous notes. Aglio e olio is a celebration of simplicity, showcasing how a few quality ingredients, when treated with care and attention, can elevate a humble bowl of pasta into a culinary delight that's both elegant and deeply satisfying.</p>
        <!-- Recipe list -->
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>8 ounces (225g) spaghetti or any long pasta of your choice</li>
            <li>1/3 cup (80ml) extra virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>4 cloves garlic, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon red pepper flakes (adjust to taste)</li>
            <li>Salt, to taste</li>
            <li>1/4 cup (15g) chopped fresh parsley</li>
            <li>Grated Parmesan cheese, for serving (optional)</li>
        </ul>

        <!-- Steps to cook -->
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Cook the pasta: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the spaghetti and cook according to the package instructions until al dente. Reserve about 1 cup of pasta water before draining.</li>
            <li>Prepare the sauce: While the pasta is cooking, heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the sliced garlic and red pepper flakes. Cook, stirring frequently, until the garlic is golden and fragrant, about 1-2 minutes. Be careful not to let the garlic burn.</li>
            <li>Combine pasta and sauce: Once the pasta is cooked, drain it and add it directly to the skillet with the garlic and oil. Toss the pasta to coat it evenly with the sauce. If the pasta seems dry, add some of the reserved pasta water, a little at a time, until the desired consistency is reached.</li>
            <li>Season and garnish: Season the pasta with salt to taste. Add the chopped parsley and toss to combine, ensuring that the parsley is evenly distributed throughout the dish.</li>
            <li>Serve: Transfer the aglio e olio to serving plates or bowls. If desired, sprinkle grated Parmesan cheese over the top. Serve immediately and enjoy!</li>
